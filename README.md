# Chulbul-Panda-
Project Description:

Our project, "Chul Bul Panda," is an action-packed fighting game that takes inspiration from the beloved Kung Fu Panda franchise. The game features three challenging levels, each pitting the Panda against a formidable enemy (Tai Lung, Wolf, and Kai) specific to that level.

Players will engage in intense combat, with both the Panda and the enemy having a life bar to indicate their health. Skillfully executed moves by either player will gradually decrease the opponent's life. The effectiveness of each move and its accuracy will determine the amount of damage inflicted.

To gain an advantage, the Panda must collect food items (dumplings, noodles, and ramen) that periodically appear on the screen. Gathering these food items empowers the Panda to unleash devastating power moves, significantly reducing the enemy's life.

The game continues until one player's life bar is depleted, resulting in their defeat. If the Panda emerges victorious, he advances to the next level, progressively facing tougher challenges. The ultimate objective is to conquer all three levels, emerging as the triumphant champion of the game
