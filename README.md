# Chulbul-Panda-
Project Description:

Our project name is “Chul Bul Panda”, a fighting game inspired and featuring Kung Fu Panda. There will be a total of three levels, in each level the Panda has to fight a specified enemy for that level (Tai lung, Wolf, Kai). There will be a life bar that will show the life of the panda and his enemy. Every on-point move by a player decreases the life of the opposite player. The decrease would depend on the type of move and its accuracy. To attain a bonus, the Panda has to collect the food (dumpling, noodles, and ramen for each respective level) that appears on the screen now and then. By collecting the food the panda has the power to perform a power move that decreases the life of the enemy significantly. Once the life bar, of any player, finishes that player loses. If the panda wins the level he proceeds to the next level until all three levels are cleared and he wins the game.
